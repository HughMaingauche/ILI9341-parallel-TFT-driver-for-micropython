# ILI9341-parallel-TFT-driver-for-micropython
For use with an 8-bit parallel TFT touchscreen using micropython


You'll find 2 different ILI9341 drivers for micropython in this repository :
ILI9341_ESP32 -> for use with standard ESP32 microcontroller 
ILI9341_RP2 -> for use with Raspberry PICO microcontroller

Both libraries have been fully tested using micropython 1.17

These libraries include 3 different fonts.

The libraries use micropython_viper decorator to improve speed and achieve reasonable graphic display speed

How to use the files in the repository :

1. After installing micropython on your device, copy the full content of the corresponding folder to the root directory (using Thonny, Rshell or wathever software you usually use)
